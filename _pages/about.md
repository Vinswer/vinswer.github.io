I am a Master's graduate in Bioinformatics from **Wageningen University & Research**, with a strong background at the intersection of artificial intelligence, data science, and computational biology. My academic and research journey — from a Bachelor's degree in Animal Science to a Master's degree in Bioinformatics — has demonstrated my **ability to quickly adapt and learn new fields**. This interdisciplinary path has given me a broad perspective and the ability to connect insights from different fields, which is crucial in the rapidly evolving field of AI.

During my Master's, I worked on projects in pose estimation, object detection (YOLO, Mask R-CNN), and few-shot learning (Prototypical Networks, ViT-based models), with applications ranging from animal behavior monitoring to medical image recognition. In addition to Python-based model development, I also have practical experience deploying AI models to endpoint environments using **C++**, combining research prototypes with practical and efficient system implementations.

Collaboration is another strength of mine. I have worked in multidisciplinary research teams comprised of biologists, computer scientists, hardware engineers, and data analysts, where I not only contributed technical expertise but also demonstrated interdisciplinary communication skills, enabling me to coordinate diverse perspectives towards common goals.

My professional interests lie in **combining computational methods with real-world impact**, whether through developing powerful AI models for industry applications in data analysis and computer vision, or applying AI-driven solutions to precision medicine.

I am proficient in Python, R, and machine learning frameworks, and have practical experience in model development, evaluation, and visualization. I combine technical expertise, research enthusiasm, and adaptability. I am eager to collaborate across disciplines and contribute to AI solutions in healthcare, life sciences, and data-driven industries.
